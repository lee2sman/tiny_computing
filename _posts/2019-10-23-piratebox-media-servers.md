# How to set up Raspberry Pi PirateBox without ssh

* These steps are intended to be followed after creating a Piratebox disk image and starting it up in the Raspberry Pi.

## change password of alarm user

```
> passwd
```

## enable fake-timeservice

### set date and time

```
> sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
> sudo date -s "20170904 1603"
> cd /opt/piratebox && sudo ./bin/timesave.sh ./conf/piratebox.conf install
```
### enable on startup

```
> sudo systemctl enable timesave
```

### optional: enable the imageboard and discussionboard

```
> sudo /opt/piratebox/bin/board-autoconf.sh
```

### enable usb thumb drive share OR extend SDcard

USB: ```> sudo /opt/piratebox/rpi/bin/usb_share.sh```

SDCard: ```> sudo /opt/piratebox/rpi/bin/sdcard_share.sh```

### optinoal: enable UPnP media server

```
> sudo cp /etc/minidlna.conf /etc/minidlna.conf.bkp
> sudo cp /opt/piratebox/src/linux.example.minidlna.conf /etc/minidlna.conf
> sudo systemctl start minidlna
> sudo systemctl enable minidlna
```

### enable realtimeclock timekeeping
```
> sudo systemctl enable rpi_hwclock
```

## TO START:

```
sudo systemctl start minidlna
sudo systemctl enable minidlna
```

## Modifications

### Use a USB drive on your Pi

1. Plug in a USB. Wait for your command line to come back.
2. ```sudo /opt/piratebox/rpi/bin/usb_share.sh```
3. You can access your files at ```/mnt/usbshare```
4. For example, to move a file from your usb to your Pi's web content folder:
```
cp /mnt/usbshare/index.html /opt/piratebox/share/content
```
*Note: this will overwrite any index.html file that is already in that folder*

### Change the SSID / Network name

By default, your piratebox network will be called **PirateBox - Share Files Freely**. You can change this!

Your file ```/opt/piratebox/conf/hostapd.conf``` contains configuration to name the SSID network name.

For example, type 

```
nano /opt/piratebox/conf/hostapd.conf
```

In the line that starts ```ssid``` change the network name to a name of your choice.

Save. (```Control-O``` and then hit enter.)

Quit (```Control-X```)

Then reboot your system.


### Change the display URL

The default displayed url is: **piratebox.lan**.

To change this, run:

```
sudo /opt/piratebox/bin/install_piratebox.sh /opt/piratebox/conf/piratebox.conf hostname new_name
```

replace *new_name* with whatever url name you like.


### To change the landing page

Your piratebox's landing page index, css, images and js files are located at: ```/opt/piratebox/share/content```

You'll see index.html, stylesheet and javascript files there. You can edit these to serve any content. 

### To see changes, restart the Piratebox server

```
sudo systemctl start minidlna
sudo systemctl enable minidlna
```

### Create an alias for starting the server

If you don't want to re-type the commands to restart the server every time, make a single word alias.

```
alias piratebox="sudo systemctl start minidlna && sudo systemctl enable minidlna"
```

This will save it as a temporary alias.

Going forward, you can use this alias as a shortcut. Just type ```piratebox``` to run the commands to start the Piratebox.

To permanently save this alias in computer's memory, add the above alias line to your ```.bashrc``` file.

To change that, ```nano .bashrc```


### Shutting down the pi

```sudo shutdown -H``` will start a (silent) one minute timer and then shutdown after a minute.

## Homework

Get your Piratebox to work. Develop a concept for your Piratebox server. Customize the landing page and network name. Add any additional functionality. When complete, consider moving the SD card to a dedicated [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400), a $10 Pi.
