### What have we learned?

Let's look back at our **Goals of the course**

At the beginning of the semester we laid out the goals of this course: 

> Students create custom projects using inexpensive, bank cardâ€“sized computers for art installations and works for the public good. Students will conceptualize, design and implement new computer-based devices and participate in critique of contemporary technology and networked devices. In the process, their knowledge of text-based interfaces, free culture, collaboration, circuit building, and the history of creative computing/hacking is deepened.--*from the [syllabus](http://leetusman.com/tiny_computing/syllabus.html)!*

Here's an overview of what we've done:

- What we mean by the term tiny computing
- a brief history of computing and the hardware/software stack
- The physical hardware that make up a basic computer
- overview of hacking culture, free culture and the free/libre and open source software communities
- What Linux is and where it came from
- Installing and working with the GNU/Linux operating system
- Raspberry Pi and single board computers and how to set them up
- Using the command line to control, customize, automate your computer
- Remotely connecting securely to a computer
- Using and experimenting with software to work with hardware and sensors
- a broad overview of 3d fabrication technology including laser cutting and 3d printing
- ethical issues relating to computing, hardware projects and post-colonial computing
- creating our own private networks with Piratebox
- an introduction to Bash shell and language, and the Python programming language
- overview of artist projects using Raspberry Pi and the conceptual, social and technical underpinnings of their works

### Documentation

Your final project is due next week. A completed project includes:

- Video of you demonstrating your project. Shoot for between about a minute and no more than 3 minutes total. Show the entirety of the project, explain the concept and show how to use it. Make the documentation compelling and well-made! 
- a completed project, placed online in Moodle. I will then be able to place these on our tiny computing website. Please write in plain text, html, markdown but not a pdf.
 - title of project
 - group members
 - 1 - 2 paragraph well-written conceptual description
 - A detailed step-by-step project building tutorial
   - what parts/hardware are needed/used
   - What software is needed used (and where to get it)
   - a numbered procedure to be able to reproduce the project. Ideally with photos/screenshots of steps along the way.
   - all code posted online (ideally in a github repo.)
- project manual (how to use it) - This should be written in the clearest possible detailed manner. For example, you may want to have a diagram of buttons on your device, or a manual for how to change some aspect of the software.
- Also attach your logs of your activity and weekly photo documentation

### Open Studios tomorrow!
