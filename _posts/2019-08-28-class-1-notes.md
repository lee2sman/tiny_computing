# Homework:

1. Install the Raspbian operating system on your Raspberry Pi. Boot it up. Configure networking. Open a web browser and access a website.
2. Writing assignment: Write a paragraph or two about your goals for the course. Why did you sign up for the class? What are you interested in learning? What are you confused about? What are you excited about? These are just example questions. Feel free to touch on other topics.
3. Reading and writing assignment: Read Alan Kay's 1968 paper [A Personal Computer For Children of All Ages](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/hc_pers_comp_for_children.pdf) where he proposes a Dynabook. After reading, consider the present state of our personal laptops, tablets and phones. In a few paragraphs describe in what ways we have realized or failed to achieve Kay's vision.
