---


### In this class: Advanced Linux commands

### Class learning groups

1. Encryption Team
2. Collaboration / Multi-Users Team
3. Automation Team
4. Gluing together software with Pipes |


### Encryption

- Public / Private Keys
- SSH Keys

Ways to connect to you Pi in the Terminal:

#### Encryption / Remote Connection with ssh

1. ```ssh pi@xxx.xx.xx.xx```
2. Enter your password

Alternative 1-liner

Authorize your laptop to log into your Pi using SSH Keys

### Permissions and Users

Files and directories (folders) are owned by a user. Every file and directory is part of a group.

All users are members of groups.
 
There are three levels of permissions for every file:
1. Read permission
2. Write permission
3. Execute permission

Changing permissions with ```chmod```.

### Automation

#### Daemons

A [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) is a background process. 

You can set your own tasks to run using ```cron```. Cron uses ```crontab```, a type of cron table file. 

There is a mini language to create a crontab to run processes automatically.

#### Gluing together software with Piping

Piping and Redirection

```||``` = a pipe

```>>``` redirection

Commands with a single bracket overwrite the destinationâ€™s existing contents. Commands with a double bracket do NOT overwrite.

```
    > - standard output

    < - standard input

    2> - standard error
```

1. Teams: create your markdown tutorial file. Add images if helpful. Upload the markdown file and any image files.
2. Project writing:
 - what are you making?
 - what resources are you using?
 - what questions do you have?
 - order parts for next class
