## Project Review

### Documentation Review

#### Offline-Pedia


Offline-Pedia is a project by undergraduate students at Yachay University in Ecuador to bring  Wikipedia to rural communities. The students are using Raspberry Pi computers running Raspbian, re-purposed CRT televisions and wood for housing the computers. The Offline-Pedia contains both Wikipedia and full free books from Project Gutenberg, running the software [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/), an offline wikipedia, text and media browser.

> The boulder from the region Neuenkirchen, Niedersachsen contains a thermoelectric generator which converts heat directly into electricity. Visitors are invited to make a fire next to the boulder to power up the wifi router in the stone which then reveals a large collection of PDF survival guides. The piratebox.cc inspired router which is NOT connected to the Internet offers the users to download the guides and upload any content they like to the stone database. As long as the fire produces enough heat the router will stay switched on. The title Keepalive refers to a technical network condition where two network endpoints send each other ’empty’ keepalive messages to maintain the connection.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive To visit the piece please arrange an appointment with Springhornhof.de.

>  Algorithms are already looking through the viewfinder alongside with you: they adjust settings, scan faces and take a photo when you smile. What if your grin wasn't the only thing they cared about?
> Camera Restricta is a speculative design of a new kind of camera. It locates itself via GPS and searches online for photos that have been geotagged nearby.
If the camera decides that too many photos have been taken at your location, it retracts the shutter and blocks the viewfinder. You can't take any more pictures here.
