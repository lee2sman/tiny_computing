### Installation Options

{% include image.html image="3bplus.png" %}

[Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
- Use this for a dead simple drag and drop program to flash an operating system onto a SD card

[PiBakery](https://www.pibakery.org/)
- a block-based drag and drop way to set up your Raspberry Pi operating system with some good basic configurations

[Additional and Advanced installation options](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) - The Raspberry Pi Foundation's page links to instructions for Mac, PC, Linux and ChromeOS. dd is a command-line program to write disk images to an external drive. Be careful! Don't overwrite your own hard drive!

Note: The Raspberry Pi foundation has a piece of software called NOOBS that is designed for installing an operating system. I think both Etcher and PiBakery are easier, but you're welcome to try it.

### Setting up your Pi

[Info on raspi-config](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md), the text-and-menus Text User Interface, aka TUI, that pops up the first time you start up Raspbian. 

[Setting up networking](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md)

### Command Line

[The Terminal](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/terminal/README.md) - Working with the command line is pretty essential to do any sort of customization on your Raspberry Pi. And the skills you learn there can be transferred to any Mac or other Linux computer.

### Camera Module
